How to adjust image size for diff screen sizes .use MediaQuery to get device dimensions

You can give custom height and width to the image or parent widget to show accordingly screen resolutions.

Here is the different way to get width and height.

Getting width is easy but height can be tricky, following are the ways to deal with height

// Full screen width and height
double width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
double height = MediaQuery.of(context).size.height;

// Height (without SafeArea)
var padding = MediaQuery.of(context).padding;
double height1 = height - padding.top - padding.bottom;

// Height (without status bar)
double height2 = height - padding.top;

// Height (without status and toolbar)
double height3 = height - padding.top - kToolbarHeight;
You can use width /2 or /3 for the width of the image and the same for height. It will work for Android, iOS, or other platforms too.

------- images in the app
You'd simple need to arrange your files as follow:

images/0.75x/my_icon.png (ldpi inside 0.75x folder)
images/my_icon.png (mdpi directly inside images)
images/1.5x/my_icon.png (hdpi inside 1.5x folder)
images/2.0x/my_icon.png (xhdpi inside 2.0x folder)
images/3.0x/my_icon.png (xxhdpi inside 3.0x folder)
images/4.0x/my_icon.png (xxxhdpi inside 4.0x folder)
And when you use Image.asset("images/my_icon.png") flutter will automatically assign the correct asset.
